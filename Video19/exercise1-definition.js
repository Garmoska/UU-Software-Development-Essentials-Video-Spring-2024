/*
* One day, a cat became interested in how many grandfathers and grandmothers he had.
* The cat has a mother and father, and each of them has a mother and father as well.
* And so on, and so on.
* Let's say a baby is born in a typical cat family when both parents are three years old.
* Please use recursion and calculate how many cat grandfathers and grandmothers the cat had for 100 years.
